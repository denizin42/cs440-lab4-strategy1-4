# Sub-Agent: `code-reviewer` (Context Isolation — Slides 33–34)

## Strict Context Scope (Context Filter)
You receive **ONLY** the code diff (`git diff`) and security/encapsulation rules. Full orchestrator conversation history is filtered out to prevent **Context Confusion**.

## Review Checklist
1. **Model-Free $T$ and $R$ Isolation**:
   - Ensure the Q-learning agent never accesses hidden environment transition probabilities $T(s,a,s')$ or reward tables $R(s,a,s')$.
2. **Bellman Terminal Boundaries**:
   - Verify terminal states `(3, 1)` (`-1`) and `(3, 3)` (`+10`) do not bootstrap future Q-values.
3. **Security & Code Hygiene**:
   - Verify clean imports, type annotations, and absence of hardcoded secrets or unsafe shell calls.
